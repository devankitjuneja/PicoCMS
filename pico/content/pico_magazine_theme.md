Setting up a Pico CMS theme, how hard could that be? So, I started searching a suitable theme for my blog and I came across a `Magazine` theme by Pico.  
I thought, this is it. It's simple, easy to manage and great looking. However, I was scratching my head for the next two days on its search and category functionality.  

Note: Don't judge me pico users.

### Let's cover the basics

Although, Pico is not like any other CMS platforms, it's simple and requires little configuration. Sometimes that little configuration could take days because of the bad documentation.

For the `Magazine` theme to work - you need pico installed on your computer. Here's a [link](http://picocms.org/docs/) to its documentation.

You will get magazine theme from [here](https://github.com/BesrourMS/magazine).

### Installing the theme

It's as simple as copying and pasting.
Place magazine folder inside themes folder of your pico installation. And you are good to go.

### Running the installation

Navigate to your pico installation directory and edit `config.yml` file.

```sh
$ cd pico
$ nano config.yml
```
